- **Intrusion/Virus Detection:** A change in the hash value of a file may indicate an intrusion or a virus.
- **Construction of a pseudorandom number generator:** One of the required properties of a cryptographic function is that the output has to pass pseudorandomness tests.
- **File synchronization:** Whether to upload a file or not for synchronization (for example with the cloud storage) can be determined by checking the hash value of the file has changed or not since the last update

# Notes
Hash functions can be used for intrusion detection and virus detection. This is done by storing the hash of the file for each file on a system and securing the hash values (e.g., on a flash drive that is kept secure). One can later determine if a file has been modified (by a virus or someone else) by recomputing
the hashes and comparing them with the secured hash values. An intruder would need to change the hash value of a file without changing the file itself to hide his/her actions. However, the collision resistance property makes it very hard for the intruder to make such a change.

A cryptographic hash function can be used to construct a pseudorandom function (PRF) or a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), the output from a hash need to pass tests for pseudorandomness.
