- **SHA:** Secure Hash Algorithm 

  - **SHA-1** 
Designed by NSA
Published by NIST in 1993 as Federal Info. Processing Standard
Theoretical attacks developed for SHA1 in 2005 suggested the algorithm may not be secure enough for ongoing use.

  - **SHA-2** 
Also designed by NSA
Published by NIST in 2001 as Federal Info. Processing Standard
Includes six hash functions with digests that are 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits.
